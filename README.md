## Message from Tron (Original Author) "Also, the invite link is broken."

Hey everyone! I'm 17 and I'm extremley interested in the world of Programming, Computer Science, and Blockchain technologies. I came to this project with an open mind, ready to see how my prior programming skills fared in terms of making a fully functional Discord Bot, which I previously had only done once before. If you want to use this app then I highly recommend you use [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=521134829216071730&permissions=0&scope=bot) to invite the Discord bot to your server and start using it. If you have any feature suggestions then feel free to shoot me an email at tron.schell@protonmail.com.
